# Palindrome Checker

A simple, clean web application that checks if a given text is a palindrome. Built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## 🔍 What is a Palindrome?

A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequence of characters that reads the same forward and backward. Examples include:
- "racecar"
- "A man a plan a canal Panama"
- "12321"

## ✨ Features

- **Clean, modern UI** with a minimalist design
- **Real-time palindrome detection** that ignores spaces, punctuation, and case
- **Keyboard support** - press Enter to check
- **Responsive design** that works on all devices
- **Input validation** to ensure meaningful input

## 🚀 Demo
[Live Demo]()
Simply enter any text into the input field and click "Check" or press Enter to see if it's a palindrome!

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **HTML5** - Structure and markup
- **CSS3** - Styling with modern features like flexbox and custom properties
- **JavaScript (ES6+)** - Logic and interactivity
- **Google Fonts (Inter)** - Clean, readable typography

## 📁 Project Structure

```
palindrome-checker/
├── index.html          # Main HTML file
├── style.css           # Stylesheet with modern design
├── script.js           # JavaScript functionality
└── README.md           # Project documentation
```

## 🎯 How It Works

1. **Input Processing**: The application takes user input and removes all non-alphanumeric characters
2. **Case Normalization**: Converts the cleaned string to lowercase for comparison
3. **Palindrome Check**: Compares the processed string with its reverse
4. **Result Display**: Shows whether the original input is a palindrome or not

## 💻 Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/jericho066/palindrome-checker-fcc.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory**
   ```bash
   cd palindrome-checker
   ```

3. **Open in your browser**
   - Simply open `index.html` in your preferred web browser
   - Or use a local server like Live Server in VS Code

## 🎨 Design Features

- **Minimalist Interface**: Clean white card design on a subtle gray background
- **Modern Typography**: Using Inter font for excellent readability
- **Smooth Interactions**: Subtle hover effects and focus states
- **Mobile Responsive**: Optimized for all screen sizes
- **Accessibility**: Proper contrast ratios and keyboard navigation

## 🧪 Example Test Cases

Try these examples to see the palindrome checker in action:

**Palindromes:**
- `racecar`
- `A man a plan a canal Panama`
- `Was it a car or a cat I saw?`
- `12321`
- `Madam`

**Not Palindromes:**
